# CineStill CS41 Development Times Reference Poster

This poster provides an easy-to-read, large-format reference for the **CineStill CS41 C-41 color negative film kit**. It lists the times and notes for each processing step—Developer, Bleach / Fix, Wash / Rinse, and Stabilizer—formatted for quick use while working in the darkroom. I got tired of having to pick up the instructions to double-check the tiny print all the time, so here's an easier solution!

There's an optional 2nd line with push/pull processing times which can be uncommented if desired. (Maybe I'll generate a different variations versions and upload them the next time I dust this off.)

## Generating the Poster

If you make any code changes, simply run the generate_chart script to regenerate the PDF and output it to the program's directory. It depends on the `reportlab` package, which you'll probably need to install with uv/pip/pipx.
